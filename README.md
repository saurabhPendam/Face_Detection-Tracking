# Face_Detection-Tracking
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.

Haar Cascade FrontalFace Algorithm:
- It is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function. 
- This uses machine learning techniques to get a high degree of accuracy from what is called “training data”. 
- This uses “integral image” concepts to compute the “features” detected. 
- Haar Cascades use the Adaboost learning algorithm which selects a small number of important features from a large set to give an efficient result of classifiers.
